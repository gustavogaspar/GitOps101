# GitOps 101
This is a beginners guide for those who are interested on GitOps using the Oracle Cloud Infraestructure

In this this tutorial a full develpment pipeline will be created using a Git Repository as a guideline for the execution of the jobs. At first a Python backend will be deployed on a kubernetes cluster using manual jobs, then a pipeline will be created, and linked to the git repository, to use git activities as a trigger to update the Python backend.
