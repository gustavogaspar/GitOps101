# Checking the app status with Oracle Cloud Shell
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Cloud (OCI) Shell is a web browser-based terminal accessible from the Oracle Cloud Console. Cloud Shell is free to use, and provides access to a Linux shell, with a pre-authenticated Oracle Cloud Infrastructure CLI, a pre-authenticated Ansible installation, and other useful tools for following Oracle Cloud Infrastructure service tutorials and labs. Cloud Shell is a feature available to all OCI users, accessible from the Console.

## Initializing the Cloud Shell

1. Login to the Console.
[Sign In](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/)

2. Click the Cloud Shell icon in the Console header. Note that the OCI CLI running in the Cloud Shell will execute commands against the region selected in the Console's Region selection menu when the Cloud Shell was started.

3. This displays the Cloud Shell in a "drawer" at the bottom of the console

4. The Cloud Bash already has the oci client installed, so lets try some commands:
 ```oci iam compartment list ```

  _ABOUT: This command lists all compartments in your tenancy_

 ```oci os ns get ```

  _ABOUT: This command shows the storage namespace of your tenancy_

## Accessing your Kubernetes Cluster using Cloud Shell

1. Access the OCI console:
[Sign In](https://console.us-ashburn-1.oraclecloud.com/)

2. On the OCI Console, click on the **Menu icon** in the top-left corner.

3. Under **Developer Services**, and then select **Container Clusters (OKE)**.

4. Select the cluster that you created for this lab.

5. At the top of the page, click on **Access Cluster**

6. Click on **Launch Cloud Shell** then execute **the command** that shows in the popup.

_IMPORTANT: Save the command on the notepad, it will be needed for the next lab_

7. To test the connection you can execute the following command:

 ```kubectl get nodes ```

  _ABOUT: This command lists all nodes of your cluster_

## Creating the secret for the registry
This step will create a secret in your token that enables your kubernetes cluster to pull images from your Oracle Cloud Infraestructure Registry

1. Within the Cloud Shell, execute this command changing the following information:

- docker-server:  < Registry URL >
- docker-username: < Storage Namespace >/< Full user name>
- docker-password: '< Auth Token>'
_IMPORTANT: The Auth Token **must** be inside quotion marks_
- docker-email: exemple@exemple.com

```kubectl create secret docker-registry ocir --docker-server=<your-registry-server> --docker-username=<username> --docker-password='<password>' --docker-email=<your-email>```
